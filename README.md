# ARColl (ada-relax-component-collection) 

ARColl is a reusable library that contains basic components (types and packages) useful to experiment in Ada 2012 programming language. It includes an own version of unbounded string which solves memory leaks observed in the standard library, a JSON encoder and decoder and few functions for basic vector/matrix operations.

ARColl is written in pure Ada 2012; however it was tested only with the GNAT GPL 2016 compiler.
